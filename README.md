So here is the description

This is just an list, like, my own self-made list, which would be updated when needed.

The list might not be usable as it is ip targeted filter. You might set your ip accordingly to your choice for the experience needed.
The repository also contains a official AdGuard DNS filter included. The filter was saved on 8 November 2023.

Update: Don't look into "IntrusiveSite.txt". Copy this into Adguard Home DNS Blocklist instead: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/User2517177/AdGuard-Blocklist/main/IntrusiveSite.txt
